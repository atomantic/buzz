# A Standard Buzzphrase Generator: antic/buzz

## Standard Lib
This is a standard lib wrapper for [buzzphrase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buzzphrase)

Mainly this exists just as a way for me to play with `serverless` frameworks and platforms.


## Usage

before using, you'll need the [stdlib](https://stdlib.com/) cli:
```
npm i -g lib
# see setup instructions here: https://github.com/atomantic/stdlib
```

Then you can run the remote standard lib
```
f antic/buzz
f antic/buzz 2
f antic/buzz 3
# etc...
```
